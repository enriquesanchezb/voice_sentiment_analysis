Hi John, how have you been?
I've been good, just exploring some new tech gadgets.
Really? Which one have you found interesting?
I've been experimenting with a new VR headset. It's quite impressive!
Wow, I'd love to try it out sometime. Do you recommend it?
Yes, it's definitely worth checking out. Let me know if you want to come over and give it a go.
Will do. Let's plan it for this weekend.
