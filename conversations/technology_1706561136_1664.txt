Hi John, have you had a chance to check out the new software update for our project?
Yes, I have. It seems to have some bug fixes and improved performance.
Great, I'll test it out myself later today. Do you think we should present it to the team tomorrow?
That sounds good. Let's prepare a brief demo and send it around beforehand.
Sounds like a plan. I'll also compile a list of known issues and workarounds for our colleagues.
Got it. Looking forward to presenting our progress to the team.
